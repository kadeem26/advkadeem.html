      <p class="me">My name is Kadeem H. Sweeney. I currently attend the University of Connecticut (UConn) in Stamford as a
        Digital Media Major. However as a child I would've never imagined attending such a wonderful university or
        even coming to the United States. I was born in Westmoreland Jamaica on September, 26, 1996. I lived in
        Jamaica with my mom, older sister, grandma, two aunts and two younger Cousins. Basically my mother's side
        of my family. I lived in Jamaica for eleven years of my life until I moved. At this point I’ve lived in the
        states equally as long however, I didn't move to the states until February of the year 2008. One day I came
        home from school and my mother was telling me how my father wanted me to come live with him in Stamford
        Connecticut. After continuous discussions she convinced me to go live with my dad because I would have
        a better opportunity to succeed in the states. Coming to the states was my second time on an airplane
        and the experience was awesome. I was an unaccompanied minor so the flight attendant let me and my
        brother sit first class. Also she allowed me to speak on the mike and tell everyone they could
        unbuckle their seatbelts and move around. But the best part of the flight was when we landed and were
         departing the flight attendant took me and my brother into the captain’s booth and we got to meet the
        captain and take a picture with the captain’s hat on. After all these things happened I decided
       that moving to this country was the best decision of my life.

  <P>   While in Jamaica my favorite sports consisted of football and cricket. Most of what I did other
    than attend school was revolved around watching, playing or talking about football and cricket. To
    me football was the greatest sport until I came to the U.S. and became involved in lacrosse. I did
    not stop enjoying football however, lacrosse became my passion. I did not get into watching lacrosse
     as much as I got into playing. It took a while before I became a lacrosse player. Upon arrival to
      Connecticut in 2008 I was still in elementary school so all I could really do was play sports in gym.
       After leaving elementary school I ended up playing baseball and doing wrestling and track in middle school.
        However doing all these sports I never felt as happy as I did playing soccer until my freshman year
        of high school. It was spring time (lacrosse season) and I was going to try out for baseball but one
        of my friends convinced me to try out for lacrosse because they need players. At first I wasn’t going
        to play but they convinced me. At the time I did not even know what lacrosse was But, I tried out and
        made Junior varsity and just fell in love with the sport. I was still relatively new to it so it took
         me a while to make varsity but I got there eventually. I practiced every single day, worked out and
          practiced my ball skills. I literally played in rain, snow, hail whatever the weather. I trained super
           hard to become a starter. First I was captain of the junior varsity squad and then I made varsity the
           following year. I just enjoyed the game except for when my team loses. To me lax was one of the greatest
            sports ever created and I just give thanks to the native Americans for creating the game.
